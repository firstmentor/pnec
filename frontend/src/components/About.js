                This 400-year old art form makes toys from soft wood known as
                tella poniki, where each part is carved separately. These pieces
                are then joined together with makku, a paste of tamarind seed
                powder and sawdust. Later after drying, details are added and
                the toys are coloured with either oil and watercolours or
                vegetable dyes and enamel paints. These toys are showcased every
                year at the celebration of Sankranthi, and this showcase is
                known as Bommala Koluvu.

                This tribal art from Maharashtra is among the finest examples of
                folk paintings in India. The Warli paintings are traditionally
                painted inside the walls of village huts, and use a set of basic
                geometric shapes like circles, triangles, and squares. These
                geometric shapes do not depict mythological characters or images
                of deities, but depict the social everyday life of the
                villagers. To paint the mud walls, artists use white paint made
                by grinding rice into white powder, mixed with water.{' '}

                The wood carving in Manipur is done on two types of wood,
                locally known as wang and heijuga. Trees are cut when they are
                mature, and then the logs are seasoned properly to preserve the
                natural colour of the wood. The traditional motifs of Manipuri
                culture are carved by artisans. The resin is applied to decorate
                leather belts, swords and sword handles.

                varieties of bamboo and cane products that are both utilitarian
                and decorative. The Mizo men are experts at cane and bamboo
                work. The traditional Mizo hat looks as if the hat is woven out
                of fine bamboo as fine as cotton yarn. Bamboo and cane are also
                used to make flower vases, baskets and utensils. The domestic
                baskets are all made from plaited bamboo and are reinforced by a
                stout cane, which is very hard and durable. By smoking, the cane
                is coloured shiny mahogany to add some colour and patterns.

                Jaipur’s blue pottery originally came from Persia, but today is
                widely recognised as a traditional craft of Jaipur. The base for
                blue pottery is a mix of quartz, powdered glass, stone powder,
                borax, multani mitti, gum and water. The name, however, comes
                from the cobalt blue dye used to colour the pottery. The
                technique beautifully produces decorative items such as
                doorknobs, tiles, pots, vases and plates, but be careful as
                being fired at very low temperature makes them fragile..

                The state’s traditional lepcha weave is synonymous with handloom
                weaving in Sikkim. This kind of weave goes back to ancient times
                when the Lepcha tribe were said to use yarn spun from stinging
                nettle (sisnu) plants to weave their clothes. Locally known as
                thara, lepcha weaves are woven in vertical looms with a
                backstrap, thus resulting in a shorter fabric width. Traditional
                designs with different colours are used to make bedspreads,
                curtains, bags, cushion covers, belts, table mats, tray cloths
                etc, apart from the traditional dress of Lepchas.

                An integral part of the hill society, the tradition of wood
                carving or likhai in Uttarakhand is inspired by the natural
                beauty of the region. These carvings are among the most famous
                traditional crafts of India. They are renowned for their simple
                yet delicate and attractive designs and can be found on the
                dwellings of the people who live there, primarily in the form of
                folk, religious and tantric motifs.{' '}

                This ancient metal casting art is a tribal art form which comes
                from the Dhokra Damar tribes of West Bengal. This traditional
                art is used to make stunning metal figurines from bronze and
                copper-based alloys using a ‘lost wax casting’. One of the
                earliest known Dhokra artefacts is the famous statue of the
                dancing girl of Mohenjo-Daro. This art is still used to make
                artefacts, accessories, utensils and jewellery, and is
                differentiated by its rustic simplicity, enchanting folk motifs
                and clean, distinctive, lines. An old art, dhokra is one of the
                most famous traditional arts of India.

              <p class="card-text">
                The world-famous pashmina shawls from Jammu and Kashmir are made
                from raw unspun wool of domesticated changthangi goats. This
                warm woollen fabric is turned into a fine shawl through an
                elaborate process and is a specialised job as the softness has
                to be retained through every step. Usually, it is woven in three
                patterns, twill or sade bunai, the popular diamond or
                chasm-e-bulbul, and the special herringbone style or gada kond.
                Pashmina shawls are counted as one of the most famous
                traditional crafts of India.
